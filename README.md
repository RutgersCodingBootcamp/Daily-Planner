# Daily Planner

At the top of the page the correct date is displayed

The daily planner application dynamically displays hours in the day.

These are constructed in a table and have an hour textbox and a save button.

The text input section turns red, green, or gray depending on if the time is in the past present or future.

When a user types in the selected time block and hits save, their text information will be uploaded to their local storage so that it can be displayed when relaunching the page.
